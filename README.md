# Javascript-Calculator-with-geolocation
It is a simple calculator made using HTML5 and Javascript performing all the basic operations.It responds to both click and keyboard events.

The background of the calculator displays the current location of the user using Google Maps and shows a marker at that place.The calculator also uses HTML5 Local Storage to save the result of last calculation even if the browser is closed.It will display the last result when it is reopened.

Note:- 
The geolocation background currently works only in Firefox due to a bug in Google Chrome.Click on the share location when the browser shows a pop-up to enable firefox to use the user's current location.Check out Calculator screenshot.png to see how the caculator looks.
